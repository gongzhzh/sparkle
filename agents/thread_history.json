I\u2019ll remember what you tell me and apply it in this session (and future ones if you want).\n\nHere are common preference categories \u2014 pick any to set now, or tell me which ones you care about and I\u2019ll ask only about those:\n\n1. Tone / formality: casual, neutral, or formal.\n2. Length / level of detail: very brief, concise, medium, or in-depth.\n3. Structure / format: bulleted lists, numbered steps, short paragraphs, or full documents; include headers or not.\n4. Examples & concreteness: give examples, analogies, or keep explanations abstract.\n5. Follow-up behavior: always ask clarifying questions, ask when unsure, or proceed without asking.\n6. Citations / sources: include links and sources, summarize without links, or cite only on request.\n7. Code / technical output: preferred programming languages, include runnable examples, include comments, or pseudocode only.\n8. Output style preferences: use plain text, minimal formatting, or include markdown/code blocks.\n9. Accessibility / readability: simpler language, more visuals (descriptions), larger sections, or keep standard.\n10. Personalization: preferred name and pronouns; any topics to avoid or prioritize.\n11. Privacy / memory: what I should not store or mention later.\n\nQuick question set I can run through (takes ~1\u20132 minutes):\n- Preferred tone? (casual / neutral / formal)\n- Detail level? (brief / medium / in-depth)\n- Format? (bullets / numbered steps / paragraphs)\n- Include examples? (yes / no)\n- Ask clarifying questions? (always / when unsure / never)\n- Want citations? (links / summary only / on request)\n- Any languages or domains you prefer or avoid?\n- Preferred name and pronouns?\n- Anything I should not remember or bring up later?\n\nWhich way would you like to proceed \u2014 answer the quick questions, set only a couple preferences now, or have me suggest a balanced default set?"
